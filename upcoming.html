            <p class="item">27th: Memorial Day Parade, Grafton. 
              Remember Grafton is on Monday. Will be meeting across from the housing Authority building like usual at 8:30 9:00 at the very latest, ready to tune. Remember that they start blocking streets at 8:30 so plan accordingly (whichever way you come in determines the way that you leave). If you would like to park at the beginning, the best way is to go through Pruntytown, and along the outside of Grafton. We will be wearing full dress so please make sure you have all items needed for that attire. Bring black shirt in case temperatures are exceeding 70 to 75Â°.</p>
