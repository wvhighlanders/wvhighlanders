            <p class="caption item">If your heart has ever been captivated by the enchanting melodies of bagpipes echoing through a misty glen or the rhythmic cadence of drums resonating across the hills, then you can truly appreciate the profound reasons that drive us to play.</p>
            <p class="item">For over seven decades, the West Virginia Highlanders of Davis & Elkins College have upheld the rich and time-honored tradition of Scottish Highland bagpiping and drumming within the Allegheny Highlands of the Mountain State. Our commitment is to perform traditional Scottish music for all occasions, bridging the past with the present.</p>
            <p class="item">The vibrant history of the West Virginia Highlanders was conceived in October 1947 through the vision of three individuals, all proud members of the American Legion. These distinguished men, namely the late Cyrus S. Kump, a prominent Elkins attorney, the late Dr. Benjamin I. Golden, a skilled Elkins surgeon, and David Dare Brown, III, now residing in Keyser, spearheaded the drive to establish a bagpipe band. Of pivotal importance was Mr. Brown, the sole local expert in the intricate art of Scottish pipes and drums. His knowledge was instrumental in bringing our organization to life. Over a span of six months, he generously imparted his expertise to a dedicated group of aspiring musicians.</p>
            <p class="item">Through extensive research into Scottish folklore and clan heritage, our organization adopted the distinctive tartan of the MacLeod of Lewis clan, which traces its origins to the Isle of Skye off the rugged western coast of northern Scotland. We were honored to receive official permission to utilize this tartan from Dame Flora MacLeod C.B.E., the 28th chief of the clan. Our band swiftly gained recognition throughout the state and the nation, gradually evolving into a world-class musical ensemble of unparalleled repute.</p>
